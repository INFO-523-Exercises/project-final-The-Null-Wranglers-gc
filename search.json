    "text": "Introduction\nLow student success rates have a profound impact on an educational institution’s academic offerings, their ability to provide financial support and scholarships, as well as their overall professional reputation. Much is unknown about how the corona-virus pandemic has impacted student success in higher education. Thus, in order to better understand this impact, this study seeks to conduct a detailed examination of the grade value outcomes during this time. By examining the grade value outcomes for the years before, during and after the pandemic, patterns and trends may be discovered that might help guide student support services in the future. The analysis will breakdown the grade values outcomes by college, department, division level and course level using clustering and classification techniques. Anomalies will be isolated for a more fine grained inspection that includes course attributes. These course attributes will be used in an effort to create a model for predictive grade value outcomes."

This investigation revolves around two primary questions:\n\nPattern Analysis – What if any patterns or relationships exist between colleges, departments, or course level and grade outcomes for enrolled students?\nPredictive Modeling – Can a predictive model be developed that accurately forecasts grade outcomes based on course attributes?"

This data should include information on grade value outcomes for courses by semester.\nCourse Attributes Data: Gather data on course attributes such as class size, instructional format (online, hybrid, in-person), faculty information, time and day of the class offering, and any other relevant features that might influence grade outcomes.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nDescriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics for overall grade distributions, college-wise, department-wise, and course-level. Examine mean, median,sums, and any potential outliers.\n\nPattern Analysis\n\nClustering: Utilize clustering techniques to group colleges, departments, and courses based on similar grade outcomes. Evaluate if specific clusters show distinct patterns during the pandemic.\nClassification: Apply classification algorithms to identify factors influencing grade outcomes. Investigate if colleges, departments, or specific course attributes significantly contribute to predicting grade results.\nAnomaly Detection: Identify anomalies in grade distributions, focusing on courses or departments that experienced unexpected changes during the pandemic. Conduct a fine-grained inspection of these anomalies.\nTime Series Decomposition: Decompose the time series data to identify trends, seasonality, and residual components. Analyze if any irregularities in the residual component coincide with the pandemic period.\n\nPredictive Modeling\n\nFeature Selection: Select relevant course attributes for predictive modeling. Use domain knowledge and statistical methods to choose features that significantly impact grade outcomes.\nModel Development: Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as regression or classification. Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.\n\nDecision Tree Analysis: Employ decision tree analysis to understand the hierarchy of factors influencing grade outcomes.\nRegression: Utilize regression for predictive model\n\nModel Evaluation: Assess the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the developed models. Compare models’ performance across different colleges, departments, and course levels.\nInterpretation: Interpret the results of the predictive models to understand the key factors influencing grade outcomes. Provide insights into how colleges, departments, and course attributes contribute to student success.\n\nReporting\n\nPrepare a comprehensive report summarizing the methodology, findings, recommendations and potential future research. This report will include visualizations such as charts and graphs to enhance the presentation of results. Clearly communicate the findings of the study in an effort to student support services and academic planning at the University of Arizona."
